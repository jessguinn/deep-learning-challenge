# Neural Network Model Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis ##

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With a machine learning and neural networks from the provided dataset using binary classifier that can predict wheather applicants will be sucessful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
